/* pos_system/css/style.css */

/*
    This file is primarily for any custom CSS that cannot be easily achieved
    with Tailwind CSS utility classes or for specific overrides.
    Most of the styling is expected to come from the Tailwind CDN.
*/

/* Example: If you need a custom font not available via CDN or Google Fonts,
   you might import it here. For this project, Inter is loaded via Google Fonts. */

/* Example: Custom focus styles if Tailwind's defaults are not sufficient */
/*
input:focus,
button:focus,
select:focus {
    outline: 2px solid #3b82f6; // Blue-500 equivalent
    outline-offset: 2px;
}
*/

/* Example: Basic custom styles for specific elements if needed */
/*
.custom-shadow {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}
*/

/*
    Note: For this simple POS system, most styling is handled by Tailwind CSS
    directly in the HTML/PHP files. This file is kept minimal as per the
    "minimal features" and "Tailwind CSS (CDN)" requirements.
