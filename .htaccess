# pos_system/.htaccess

# This file is optional and provides configuration directives for Apache HTTP Server.
# If you are using Nginx or another web server, you will need to configure
# equivalent rules in your server's configuration file.

# --- Basic URL Rewriting (Optional) ---
# Uncomment the following lines if you want to enable URL rewriting
# to remove .php extensions or create cleaner URLs.
# Requires mod_rewrite to be enabled on your Apache server.

# RewriteEngine On
# RewriteBase /pos_system/ # Adjust this if your project is not in a subfolder

# Redirect requests for index.php to the root
# RewriteRule ^index\.php$ /pos_system/ [R=301,L]

# Remove .php extension from files
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f
# RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)/$ $1.php [L]

# Deny access to .bat files (if any were uploaded or left by mistake)
<FilesMatch "\.bat$">

</FilesMatch>

# Deny access to .htaccess itself
